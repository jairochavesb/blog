<h2>Hi! I am Jairo.</h2>

I am a cybersecurity analyst, Linux and automation obsessed.

I love malware and I think it is amazing, but not due it’s destructive capabilities but how malware can have creative and crazy hacks that makes them unique and able to function in the way they do.

Malware can be seen as the same as a real life virus, bacteria or parasyte… they do harm us, yes... but if we put aside that nature, we end up with little interesting creatures worth of study.

The purpose of this blog is to have a repository of the topics I’ve been learning so I can have it at hand just in case I will need it later to review them, also I want this blog to be something I can share with others and I hope people can find useful things in here regarding malware analysis, cybersec, threat hunting, reverse engineering and some programming.

Because this blog will contain information about malware and reverse engineering for example, I want to make it clear, that I do not condone by any means the malicious use of what is found here.

All here is my own opinion.

Having written that, I hope you can find this blog useful and interesting.
