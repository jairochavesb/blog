# Golang - NMCLI Text User Interface.

My malware analysis pc died a month ago approximately, and since this was a very long weekend with a holiday extending it, I used this time to learn a new tool in the meantime I
acquired a new pc and installed all the tools I need.

I've been looking at several TUI libraries to use with Go, there are excellent libraries one of those is CLUI which the look and feel is based on Turbo Vision.

I liked that library so much that I've been playing with it the last days and had the desicion to build a small tool, and because I did use nmtui in my current in progress malware
analysis pc, I tought that writing a similar tool could be a nice practice.

The tool is very simple, just press buttons and you're set XD.

The project is here: <a href="https://github.com/jairochavesb/nmclui"> nmclui </a>

And here some screenshots.
