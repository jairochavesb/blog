# Golang - NMCLI Text User Interface.

My malware analysis pc died a month ago, and since this was a very long weekend with a holiday extending it, I used this time to learn about a tui library; in the meantime I installed all the tools I need to analyze malware on a new pc.

I’ve been looking at several TUI libraries to use with Go, there are excellent libraries out there, and one of those is CLUI which the look and feel is based on Turbo Vision.

I liked that library so much that I’ve been playing with it the last days and had the decision to build a small tool.
Because I did use nmtui when I was installing my new lab, I thought it was a nice idea to code something similar as practice.

The tool is very simple, just press buttons and you’re set XD.

The project is here: <a href="https://github.com/jairochavesb/nmclui"> nmclui </a>

And here some screenshots.
